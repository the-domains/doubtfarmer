Why are Christians so obsessed with genital mutilation? Were a group of nomads sitting around the fire 2000 years ago trying to come up with a way to stand out among other competing religions? Maybe it went something like this:  
Goat Herder \#1: "Hey, Jonah. How can we be a little different and make God proud?"

Goat Herder \#2: "Uh, how about we cut off parts of our weiner?"

Goat Herder \#1: "Sounds good. I'll sharpin' the knife."  
Worst part is the baby has no say so as to whether or not they want their private parts sliced, diced, and used for a facial lotion by [SkinMedica][0] that [Oprah endorses][1]. Look, if you're a guy and you want to cut off parts of your penis, go ahead. But a parent, or anyone for that matter, shouldn't have the right to cut off parts of "Mr. Happy". That's a decision that should be strictly left to the owner.
